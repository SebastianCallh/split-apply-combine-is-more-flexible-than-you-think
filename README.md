# Split-apply-machine-learn
Companion repo to [the blog post](https://sebastiancallh.github.io/post/split-apply-combine-is-more-flexible-than-you-think/) with the same name.

## Running the code
`cd` to the project dir, run `julia --project` to drop into the Julia shell, hit `]` to open the package manager, type `instantiate` to pull dependencies, then `include("main.jl")` to produce plots. Tested on Julia 1.8.
